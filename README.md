# My Aliucord Plugins

### [CopyWithMarkdown](https://github.com/Halkiion/aliucord-plugins/raw/refs/heads/builds/CopyWithMarkdown.zip)
Makes Discord's 'Copy Text' function copy with markdown (similarly to the newer, official Discord app / Discord RN). This also fixes an issue where emojis will copy as the name instead of as shortcodes (e.g. :husk:)

Enable "Separate buttons" in settings to keep Discord's default 'Copy Text' alongside a button for this plugin

### [CopyFileLink](https://github.com/Halkiion/aliucord-plugins/raw/refs/heads/builds/CopyFileLink.zip)
Tap and hold file attachment (such as .apk, .txt and .apk files) in chat to copy their links!
