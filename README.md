# My Aliucord Plugins

### [CopyWithMarkdown](https://github.com/Halkiion/aliucord-plugins/raw/refs/heads/builds/CopyWithMarkdown.zip)
Replaces Discord's 'Copy Text' function with one which copies markdown (similarly to the newer, official Discord app / Discord RN). This also fixes an issue where emojis will copy as the name instead of as shortcodes (e.g. :husk:)

Enable "Separate buttons" in settings to keep Discord's default 'Copy Text' alongside a button for this plugin
